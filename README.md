### About Me

I'm a student at UzSWLU, Roman-Herman faculty. Even if my area of education is far away from IT, my passion and personal interest motivated me to get into the fast growing sphere of modern industry. And that's why I made a decision to take a challenge(rs-school). I believe that hours of hard working at that course can help me to obtain useful knowledge.

### Code Example

function myFirstApp(name, age) {
    alert (`Hello my name is ${name} I'm ${age} years old and this is my first app`)

    function showSkills() {
        let skills = ['HTML', 'CSS', 'JS']
        massive = []
        for (let i=0; i<skills.length; i++) {
            massive[i] = skills[i]
        };
        alert (`I know ${massive}`);
    }
    
    function checkAge(age) {
        switch(parseInt(age)) {
            case 18:
                alert('get to the site')
        };
    }
    
showSkills();
checkAge(18)
}
